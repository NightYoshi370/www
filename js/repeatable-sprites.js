 *
 * You have several spikes on the Tiled map,
 * one right next to another, but it's such a pain
 * in the ass to put them individually...
 *
 * So you create a big `RepeatableSpriteObject` entity,
 * that's the size of all the spikes together, and it
 * will look to the player like it's a lot of spikes
 * when "actually it will be one".
